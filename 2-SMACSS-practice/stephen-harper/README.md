##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

Based on the criteria. The base deals with the overall styling. Big stuff. The layout deals with the positioning like nav, header, footer. Then the modules page would be used for specific things like classes and list items.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I didn't touch any of the CSS. I copy-pasted. It seems to work well.
